A package skill is an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/specification) that
lives inside a Kody package. The package stays the source of truth; Kody
validates it at publish and, for hosts that ask, serves it over MCP.

## Layout

```text
my-package/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── src/index.ts
└── skills/
    └── hello-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md          # required
        ├── references/
        │   └── checklist.md  # optional
        ├── scripts/          # optional
        └── assets/           # optional
```

Rules:

- One directory per skill at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- `<name>` is lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphens (max 64), and must
  equal the `name` in the frontmatter.
- No `kody.skills` manifest key. The directory convention is the declaration.

## Minimal `SKILL.md`

```md
---
name: hello-skill
description:
  Greets the user by name. Use when the user asks for a friendly hello or wants
  to see how package skills work.
---

# Hello skill

1. Ask for the person's name if you do not have it.
2. Reply with a short greeting.
3. Read `references/checklist.md` before sending anything longer than a
   sentence.
```

`name` and `description` are required. `description` is at most 1024 characters
and should say what the skill does and when to use it. Optional frontmatter:
`license`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`, and a string-to-string `metadata`
map.

## Publish

Skills ride the normal publish path. Publish checks add a `skills` check:

```text
skills ok   Validated 1 package skill: hello-skill.
skills fail Skill "skills/hello-skill/SKILL.md" is missing frontmatter "name".
```

A malformed skill fails publish, like any other check, and nothing goes live. On
success Kody digests every file under each skill directory and stores a
content-free index per published version. Packages without `skills/` are
unaffected. See [Package authoring](./package-authoring.md) and the
[package lifecycle](./package-lifecycle.md).

## Over MCP

When all of these are true, a connection serves the package's skills:

1. The `mcp-skills-extension` flag is on for the signed-in user.
2. The client connects on the 2026-07-28 MCP lane and advertises the
   `io.modelcontextprotocol/skills` extension during initialize.

Then the connection answers:

```text
skills/list              -> [{ name, description, uri: "skill://you/my-package/hello-skill/SKILL.md", ... }]
skills/get               -> one skill's SKILL.md plus its file index (uri, digest, size)
resources/read           -> skill://you/my-package/hello-skill/references/checklist.md
```

Results are scoped to packages that connection can already use (your own, plus
shared or imported ones). The tool surface stays `search`, `execute`, and `api`.
With the flag off, or a client that does not advertise the extension, nothing on
the MCP surface changes.

## Which hosts support it

Honest status against the
[official client matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients):

| Host                               | Skills over MCP                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ChatGPT                            | Partial (import at submission time) |
| fast-agent                         | Partial                             |
| MCP Inspector                      | Partial                             |
| Claude Desktop / claude.ai, Cursor | No Skills column on the matrix yet  |

Hosts that do not advertise the extension can still use the skill. Discover it
through `search`, then open the file:

```text
search({ entity: 'package:@you/my-package#skills/hello-skill/SKILL.md' })
```

## Turn it on

Signed-in users can opt in from the callout at the top of this page (it posts to
`/docs/package-skills/opt-in`). Experimenters get the flag when an admin enables
`mcp-skills-extension` for the `experiments_opt_in` audience. Default is off.

## Skill registries

A package can act as a skills registry by shipping many `skills/<name>/`
directories. A platform-wide personal registry such as `@kentcdodds/skills` is
out of scope for this feature.
