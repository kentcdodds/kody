# 0064 — OAuth consent binds a grant to one org

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-09

## Context

Teams phase 4 binds credentials to an organization. MCP OAuth is one full-access
grant ([0049](./0049-no-mcp-capability-oauth-scopes.md)); connection profiles
narrow which packages that grant can touch, they are not a permission menu.
Every person already has a personal org ([0063](./0063-teams-expand-orgs.md)). A
later team org must not silently inherit a grant minted against the personal
org.

## Decision

- Consent stamps `orgId` on the grant in **both** `props` and `metadata`.
  Refresh (and authorization-code exchange) backfills
  `orgId = props.orgId ?? props.userId` so grants minted before this stamp still
  resolve to the personal org.
- Clients may pass `?org=<slug>` on the authorize URL and/or the `/mcp`
  resource. A mismatch is an authorize error. The consent screen is **live, no
  feature flag**: one accessible org is auto-selected and the picker is hidden;
  several orgs require an explicit choice (public field is the slug, never the
  org id).
- Connection profiles stay org-bound resource narrowing (Cole §15.7). They are
  not folded into OAuth scopes.
- OIDC ID tokens and UserInfo identify the person and their selected org in
  `sub`, so clients can connect several orgs for the same person. Personal orgs
  keep the existing user-id subject, including grants without an org stamp.
  Other orgs use `org:<encoded org id>:user:<encoded user id>`, with each id
  encoded using `encodeURIComponent`. Refresh keeps the same subject.
- Grants that still lack `metadata.orgId` / `props.orgId` use the `userId`
  fallback until P9 cleanup. Do not revoke those grants from this path.

## Consequences

`/mcp` and the CLI OAuth Open API path read `orgId` from grant props and load
that org (`loadOrgBindingForOrg`), not always the person's personal org. Public
surfaces keep showing `@slug`. Revisit at P9 to drop the `userId` fallback once
every live grant has `orgId`.
