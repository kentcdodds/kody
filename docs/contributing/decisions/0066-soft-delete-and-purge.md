# 0066 — Teams soft delete, restore window, and purge lane

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-09

## Context

Teams phase 7 completes soft delete started in phase 3 expand (`deleted_at` /
`deleting_at` columns on org-owned APP_DB rows and jobs). Live reads must not
return tombstoned rows; purge must hard-delete after a retention window without
a long-lived feature flag or dual read paths.

## Decision

- **Soft delete** sets `deleted_at` (and optionally `deleting_at` while purge
  claims work). **Restore** clears those columns when `deleted_at` is within
  **30 UTC days** (`softDeleteRetentionDays`).
- **Live reads** on every APP_DB / JOBS_DB table with `deleted_at` append
  `deleted_at IS NULL` via `liveDeletedAtSql` helpers; a static scanner
  (`tools/soft-delete-read-filter.ts`) enforces this on `prepare` / `exec` SQL.
  Restore, purge, and soft-delete writers opt out file-wide with
  `soft-delete-read-filter: opt-out`.
- **Purge** runs in a dedicated lane: rows past the retention cutoff are
  hard-deleted; `deleting_at` marks in-flight purge claims. **Org delete** and
  **user offboarding** are separate flows (org vs person scope).
- **Purge audit** appends to `org_audit_events` (AUDIT_DB, **1 year**
  retention). First production purge enable is **dry-run** (log only, no hard
  deletes).
- We do **not** add a feature flag for soft-delete reads; one enforced filter
  path only.

## Consequences

Table lists and SQL helpers live under `packages/worker/src/soft-delete/`.
Filter rollout must clear scanner violations before merge gates the production
tree. Purge/offboarding implementation stays in follow-up PRs; this record
steers retention, audit, and the no-flag enforcement model.
