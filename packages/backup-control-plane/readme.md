# Production D1 backup control plane

This package is a dedicated scheduled Worker and Workflow. It is intentionally
separate from application cron and does not use `DynamicCallableWorkflow`.

## Retention prefixes

The schedule and key policy use UTC exclusively:

- Sunday UTC backups use `weekly/d1/<database-uuid>/<yyyy-mm-dd>/...` and the
  manifest retention tier `weekly`.
- All other UTC weekdays use `daily/d1/<database-uuid>/<yyyy-mm-dd>/...` and
  retention tier `daily`.

Configure the production R2 bucket lifecycle by these immutable prefixes:

- `daily/`: expire after approximately 35 days.
- `weekly/`: expire after approximately 400 days.

R2 lifecycle rules are bucket configuration and are deliberately not encoded as
application deletion logic. Before deployment, replace every placeholder in
`wrangler.jsonc`, create those lifecycle rules, provide the API token as a
secret, and set both enable variables to exactly `true` only after the export
benchmark is approved.
