				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Who is responsible for your data</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Kent C. Dodds, operator of Kody at kody.codes, is the data controller
					for the hosted service. You can reach the operator at{' '}
					<a href="mailto:support@kody.codes" mix={css(mutedLinkCss)}>
						support@kody.codes
					</a>
					. A separately operated Kody deployment has its own operator and data
					controller.

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>What Kody stores per account</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Each signed-in user gets a fully isolated assistant. Kody stores
					account profile information (email, username, optional display name
					and bio, and profile visibility), first-touch marketing attribution
					captured on public-site visits when UTM or landing context is present
					and associated with the account at signup, first-seen activation
					timestamps (email verified, first MCP connection, first execute, first
					saved package), MCP client name when known, last-active day stamps
					used for return metrics, secrets, memories, packages and their source,
					jobs, email inboxes and messages, durable storage, MCP server
					configuration, OAuth grants, package invocation tokens, short-lived
					execution history, stored community activity events, and any platform
					feedback you approve for submission. All of this remains scoped to
					your account except for content you deliberately make public
					(community listings and a public profile), the narrow admin review of
					approved platform feedback, and the community activity metadata
					described below.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					When profile visibility is <strong>public</strong>, display name, bio,
					public package metadata, and public activity are visible on{' '}
					<code>/@username</code>. When visibility is <strong>private</strong>,
					the public profile is not found.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Connected accounts</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					When you connect a third-party service — an OAuth app or API key you
					register yourself — Kody stores that connection in your account only:
					tokens, the scopes you granted, and host allowlists. OAuth access and
					refresh tokens, and a user-lane app client secret, are stored
					encrypted on that connection or app. Standalone credentials (PATs and
					API keys) stay in the encrypted secret store. Your agent and package
					code refer to them by name; Kody substitutes them at the network
					boundary and never returns the raw value to chat, search, or
					capability output.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Kody fetches data from a connected service only to fulfill a request
					you, or a job you saved, just made. Content a package or job persists
					(for example a saved summary) stays in your account under the same
					isolation rules. Kody does not sell that data, use it for advertising,
					share it with other Kody users, or use it to train a Kody model. Kody
					makes no inference calls of its own.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					<strong>Share, transfer, and disclose.</strong> Provider data leaves
					your isolated account only to Cloudflare, which hosts the application,
					database, object storage, and network; the MCP host you connected (for
					example ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor), when that host asks Kody to act
					and receives the result; the provider itself, when Kody calls its API
					with your token; and disclosure required by law. Kody does not hand
					connected-account data to other customers or advertisers.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					<strong>Protection.</strong> Tokens and OAuth grants are encrypted at
					rest, isolated per user, and sent only to hosts you approved. The
					admin role cannot read secret values, secret metadata, or OAuth
					grants. You can disconnect a connection in Kody and revoke it at the
					provider.
				</p>
				<h3 mix={css(subsectionTitleCss)}>Google user data</h3>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					When you connect Google, the rules above apply to Google user data —
					Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Gmail send, Contacts, Tasks, YouTube, and any
					other Google scopes you grant. Kody uses Google user data only to
					fulfill your request or saved job. Kody stores Google OAuth tokens
					encrypted on that Google connection and does not use Google user data
					for advertising. Kody shares, transfers, or discloses Google user data
					only with Cloudflare (hosting), the MCP host you connected when it
					asks Kody to act, Google when Kody calls Google APIs on your behalf,
					and when required by law.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>What a deployment admin can see</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					On shared deployments, operators can grant an admin role for account
					administration. Admins see account metadata: user id, username, email,
					email-verification state (including the latest verification-mail
					delivery outcome), entitlement plan, created and updated timestamps,
					role assignments, first-touch marketing attribution fields when
					present, activation first-seen timestamps, MCP client name, and
					last-active stamps. The account-administration UI lists users and
					roles; it does not expose account content. Platform feedback you
					explicitly approve for admin review is a narrow user-content
					exception.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Admins also moderate public community listings and attributed
					community reports, and can see who forked or rated a public listing,
					when, and the rating scores. One-click installs appear as forks
					because both use the same activity record. This activity view never
					includes private package source, rating notes, email, stable user ids,
					private profiles, secrets, or unrelated account content.
					Admin-configured notification packages may receive the same community
					metadata, and a metadata-only <code>user.created</code> or{' '}
					<code>user.deleted</code> event when a person account is created or
					self-deleted (stable user id, username, email, the create source or
					delete timestamp, the consumed invite code when{' '}
					<code>user.created</code> used one, and first-touch marketing
					attribution fields when present). Those lifecycle events omit
					passwords, roles, plan, secrets, and unrelated account content.
					Admin-configured notification packages may also receive a
					metadata-only <code>user.email_verification.failed</code> event when
					signup/verify mail first hits a terminal delivery failure (stable user
					id, username, email, status, <code>class</code> (
					<code>sender_block</code> / <code>other</code> / <code>null</code>),
					an admin user URL, and <code>occurred_at</code>). That event omits
					SMTP transcripts, tokens, and unrelated account content.
					Admin-configured notification packages may also receive a
					metadata-only <code>user.email_verification.stalled</code> event when
					signup/verify mail stays <code>accepted</code> for an hour with no
					Cloudflare lifecycle event (stable user id, username, email,{' '}
					<code>accepted_at</code>, stall threshold, an admin user URL, and{' '}
					<code>occurred_at</code>). That event omits SMTP transcripts, tokens,
					and unrelated account content. Admin-configured notification packages
					may also receive a metadata-only{' '}
					<code>user.email_outbound.paused</code> event when outbound sending is
					paused after a spam complaint or repeated bounces (stable user id,
					username, email, reason, bounce threshold when the reason is{' '}
					<code>bounced</code>, an admin user URL, and <code>occurred_at</code>
					). That event omits SMTP transcripts, message bodies, and unrelated
					account content. Admin-configured notification packages may also
					receive metadata-only <code>auth.denial.burst</code> or{' '}
					<code>email.delivery.burst</code> events when hourly MCP auth denials
					or shared-domain bounce/complaint counts cross their thresholds
					(count, threshold, window, insights URL, and <code>observed_at</code>
					). Those events omit user identities, tokens, recipients, and message
					content. Admin-configured notification packages may also receive a
					metadata-only <code>fleet.package_error_rate.elevated</code> event
					when anonymous package-runtime error rates rise (window bounds,
					per-metric counts and rates, public status URL, and insights URL).
					That event omits user ids, package ids, error strings, logs, and
					unrelated account content. Admin-configured notification packages may
					also receive a metadata-only <code>fleet.entitlement.crossed</code>{' '}
					event when a swept account first crosses 80% or 100% of a plan-limit
					resource, when a non-admin account first exceeds the monthly
					runtime-duration threshold, when a non-admin account first reaches a
					plan-aware unique Dynamic Worker cost threshold, or when a non-admin
					account first hits the execute cap on three of the last seven UTC
					days. Entitlement events include stable user id, username, resource
					counts, and admin dashboard URLs; runtime-duration events include
					stable user id, username, <code>total_duration_ms</code>,{' '}
					<code>threshold_ms</code>, and admin dashboard URLs;
					unique-worker-cost and repeated-execute events include the counts that
					tripped the threshold and admin dashboard URLs. These event kinds omit
					emails, plans, secrets, package source, and unrelated account content.

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Platform feedback</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					An agent may briefly describe Kody friction and ask whether you want
					it submitted. Nothing is submitted unless you explicitly approve.
					Feedback is attributed to your account and is not anonymous. Once you
					approve, the exact approved summary and details and your account user
					id, username, and email may be delivered immediately to admin review
					tools and admin-configured notifications such as Discord. No unrelated
					account content is delivered. Notifications can deep-link an admin to
					the read-only platform-feedback review surface. Admins can read and
					triage only the approved submission, and agents must omit secrets and
					unrelated private content.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Each account can create at most 10 feedback submissions in a rolling
					24-hour period and have at most 100 active submissions (open or
					triaged). Open and triaged feedback remains until it is resolved,
					dismissed, or your account is deleted. Resolved and dismissed feedback
					is removed 365 days after its last update. Your account export
					includes your submissions and their status, but not internal reviewer
					identity, notes, or timestamps. Account deletion removes any remaining
					submissions.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					When a notification is still queued, Kody rechecks that the feedback
					exists immediately before delivery and cancels it after account
					deletion when possible. Kody cannot recall a copy already delivered
					outside Kody. Admin notification copies, including Discord messages,
					may remain after Kody account deletion under the deployment
					operator&apos;s retention and deletion controls. Those copies contain
					only the exact approved feedback and its attribution, never unrelated
					account content.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>What an admin can never see</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					The admin role is not a general data-access role. Approving platform
					feedback does not let admins browse:
				</p>
				<ul mix={css(listCss)}>
					<li>Secret values or secret metadata (names, scopes, allowlists)</li>
					<li>Package invocation tokens</li>
					<li>Memories</li>
					<li>Private packages and their source</li>
					<li>Jobs</li>
					<li>Email inboxes and messages</li>
					<li>Inbound webhook endpoints and delivery logs</li>
					<li>Durable storage contents</li>
					<li>Connected MCP server configuration and OAuth grants</li>
				</ul>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					None of this appears in any admin endpoint, page, or API payload — not
					even in redacted or count form — with one qualified exception:
					platform maintenance codemods, described next, surface package
					identity, affected file paths, and fixed migration messages (never
					file contents).
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Platform maintenance (package codemods)</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					When the platform&apos;s package API changes, Kody migrates published
					package source with package codemods: versioned, deterministic
					transforms that live in the open-source repository and ship through
					code review like any other platform change. Nobody can author an ad
					hoc transform through the admin surface — admins only choose when a
					published, reviewed codemod runs, and can scope it to a dry run first.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					A codemod apply rewrites only what the reviewed transform matches,
					runs the same checks as a normal publish, records a{' '}
					<code>codemod(&lt;id&gt;): ...</code> commit in the package&apos;s own
					git history, keeps a revert snapshot, and dispatches a{' '}
					<code>package.codemod.applied</code> (or <code>.reverted</code>) event
					your packages can subscribe to. Unlocked packages also advance{' '}
					<code>published_commit</code>. Locked packages still get that commit
					on HEAD so the owner can review and promote it later; fleet apply does
					not skip them. Fleet runs are audit-logged.
				</p>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Running a codemod never shows an admin your source. Scan and run
					results expose only package identity (ids), affected file paths, and
					the codemod&apos;s own fixed finding messages — codemods are forbidden
					from embedding file contents in their findings. Ambiguous matches are
					skipped and reported for the owner rather than rewritten.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>How long Kody keeps data</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Account content such as packages, secrets, memories, jobs, and durable
					storage remains available while your account and that content exist.
					You can delete individual content or the whole account. Some
					operational records have fixed cleanup periods:
				</p>
				<ul mix={css(listCss)}>
					<li>Email delivery events: 90 days</li>
					<li>Email messages and their attachments: 365 days</li>
					<li>
						Completed workflow runs and conversation-suppression records: 90
						days
					</li>
					<li>
						Resolved or dismissed platform feedback: 365 days after its last
						update; open or triaged feedback remains until it is resolved,
						dismissed, or the account is deleted
					</li>
					<li>Audit events: 180 days</li>
					<li>Feature-flag exposure records: 90 days</li>
					<li>Daily entitlement counters: 400 days</li>
					<li>Monthly usage rollups: 24 months</li>
					<li>Stripe webhook event records: 30 days</li>
					<li>
						Non-current published bundle artifacts: at least 30 days, then
						eligible for removal when no active source or repo session needs
						them
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Deletion from a subprocessor&apos;s backups or logs follows that
					subprocessor&apos;s own retention cycle. Records may be kept longer
					when required by law, needed to resolve a dispute, or necessary to
					protect the service from abuse.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Service providers</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Kody uses these subprocessors to run the hosted service. They process
					only the data needed for their role:
				</p>
				<ul mix={css(listCss)}>
					<li>
						Cloudflare — application hosting, database, object storage, email
						delivery, security, and network infrastructure
					</li>
					<li>Stripe — paid subscriptions, billing, and payment records</li>
					<li>
						Kit — waitlist and product email subscriptions when you submit your
						email for those purposes
					</li>
					<li>
						Sentry — application error reporting and operational diagnostics
					</li>
					<li>Fathom — privacy-focused website traffic analytics</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Your choices and rights</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Use Account settings to export a copy of your Kody data or delete your
					account. Deletion asks you to type GOODBYE KODY in a confirmation
					modal, and to re-enter your password when the account has one. You can
					also ask to access, correct, delete, restrict, or receive your
					personal data, or object to its processing, by emailing{' '}
					<a href="mailto:support@kody.codes" mix={css(mutedLinkCss)}>
						support@kody.codes
					</a>
					. Which rights apply depends on where you live. We may need to verify
					your identity before acting on a request.

			<section mix={css(cardCss)}>
				<h2 mix={css(cardTitleCss)}>Deployment operator access</h2>
				<p mix={css(descriptionCss)}>
					Role-based access controls the application surface. Whoever operates
					the deployment — holding the Cloudflare account, D1 database access,
					and <code>SECRET_STORE_KEY</code> — sits outside any application-level
					control. The admin role grants no infrastructure access, and
					infrastructure access requires no admin role.
